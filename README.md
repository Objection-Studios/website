# Website
Here are some parts of our website that we have chosen to allow others to see!

### Why do we have this?
When making this although its not the best I want to let other people learn from it, weather its noticing a problem in my code they can suggest a fix for or even to take small amounts to try themselfs.

### What is on here?
Some of the code from our website (objectionstudios.com) is here, it could be an entire page to how we made a box on it. Small bits the community can help us with or we can help the community with.

### Is this updated?
Yes as of 11th May 2022 this repository is updated with nee things from time to time.

### Is that all?

### How can YOU make a change?
